# .NET examples and snippets
In this repo, you will find a lot of small projects illustrating .NET features where I got stuck trying to come up with a solution. Small problems where information was not easily available on the Internet are presented here with a small readme and most likely an article to my blog (which is written in Spanish).

Feel free to clone, fork, use, and modify this repository in any way you want, as long as you share the code publicly and contribute to expand the open source community.
